<p>Hello!</p><p>Throughout the course, we are going to be writing a lot of code.</p><p>I always recommend that you <strong>type the code alongside the video</strong>, so you learn as quickly as possible. Writing code truly is the best way to learn!</p><p>However, sometimes you'll want access to the code we're typing. This may be to refresh your knowledge, or to check whether you've made a mistake.</p><p>The code for this section is available here:Â <a href="https://github.com/schoolofcode-me/rest-api-sections/tree/master/section2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/schoolofcode-me/rest-api-sections/tree/master/section2</a></p><p>As you go through the section, go back to the code every now and then to check that what you are writing is indeed correct!</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Jose</p>
