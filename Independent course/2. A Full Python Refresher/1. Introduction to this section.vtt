00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.274
- Hi and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:06.389
In this section, we're going
to be learning about Python.

3
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.006
It's meant to be a refresher course.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.117
So if you don't have absolutely
any Python experience

5
00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:15.070
or any programming experience at all,

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.012
then this section may be a bit quick.

7
00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.082
It may go through concepts
a bit too quickly.

8
00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.699
And if that's the case, I would recommend

9
00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.718
taking a beginner Python course first.

10
00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:28.797
Now, if you have any
programming experience

11
00:00:28.797 --> 00:00:31.166
or if you have any Python experience,

12
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.511
this section, I think,
will be perfect for you.

13
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.385
Because we're going to be
going over stuff quickly

14
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.972
but everything, I hope,
will be clear and concise.

15
00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:42.628
That means it's not
going to take very long,

16
00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.959
but you'll end the section
knowing essentially

17
00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.991
everything you need to know about Python.

18
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:50.192
And once you've got that, it means that

19
00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:53.815
programming REST APIs is
going to be really easy.

20
00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.676
So this section, as I said,
is a Python refresher.

21
00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:59.790
And I encourage you to
take it if you have little

22
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.971
Python experience.

23
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.090
And, I'll see you in
the next video really.

24
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.151
We're going to get started.
