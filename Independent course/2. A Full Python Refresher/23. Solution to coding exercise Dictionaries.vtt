00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:01.667
- [Instructor] Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.126
We are here on the dictionaries

3
00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:05.591
and students coding exercise,

4
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:08.496
and this is a slightly longer
and more complex exercise,

5
00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.000
because we are progressing
through the course,

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.454
and we are getting deeper into Python.

7
00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:15.303
So let's have a look.

8
00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:17.085
It has three parts.

9
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.452
First one, create a dictionary
variable called student.

10
00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:22.202
It's partially defined here,

11
00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:23.869
and we're gonna look into exactly

12
00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.340
how we create this variable.

13
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.237
Then we're going to modify
a variable called grades

14
00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.810
down here so that it contains

15
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.999
the value of a dictionary's key.

16
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.434
We've got more information
on the comments.

17
00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.104
And finally, we're going
to implement a function

18
00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.998
calculating a total average
grade for a class of students,

19
00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:42.894
with again, good more
information on the comments.

20
00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:44.810
Let's go straight in.

21
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.592
For the first one, we're
going to create a variable

22
00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:49.957
called students that
had a dictionary in it,

23
00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:53.097
and the dictionary has
to contain three keys,

24
00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:55.595
name, school, and grades.

25
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.193
Okay, so let's do that first.

26
00:00:57.193 --> 00:00:58.097
The dictionary as we know

27
00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:01.111
is with opening and closing curly braces.

28
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.525
And then we're gonna
have name is something,

29
00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:08.076
school is something,
and grades is something.

30
00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:08.930
We don't know what yet.

31
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.748
Let's have a look.

32
00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:14.151
The values for each must be Jose for name,

33
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.367
computing for school, and a topple

34
00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:20.274
with the values 66, 77, and 88 for grades.

35
00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:21.187
Let's do that.

36
00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:24.452
The name has to be Jose, which is my name.

37
00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:27.341
School has to be computing.

38
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:31.379
Definitely not that,
computing, there we go.

39
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.174
Normally I can spell.

40
00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:35.145
And that the grades have to have a topple

41
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.685
with the values 66, 77, and 88,

42
00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:41.189
so we're gonna delete that
string, quotation marks,

43
00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.861
and we're gonna put the topple
in here, 66, 77, and 88.

44
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.352
Notice that because this is a topple

45
00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:50.667
with multiple values, we
don't need a comma at the end.

46
00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.556
In fact, we should not put it in there.

47
00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:56.306
Okay, so now we have our student.

48
00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.922
And we can move on to the
next set of instructions.

49
00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:05.816
Assume the argument, data,
which is the argument

50
00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:08.670
to this function here, is a dictionary.

51
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.222
Modify the grades variable so it accesses

52
00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.240
the grades key of the data dictionary.

53
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.863
Okay, so the grades variable right now

54
00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:18.439
doesn't equal anything,

55
00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.428
and we have to make it
equal to the grades key

56
00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:23.320
of the data dictionary.

57
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.062
Well, we know how to access
a key in a dictionary.

58
00:02:27.062 --> 00:02:30.242
We just have to do data,
which is our argument,

59
00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.159
our dictionary, grades.

60
00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:35.376
There we go.

61
00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:37.645
Now, the grades variable is accessing

62
00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:39.813
the grades key of the data dictionary.

63
00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:41.562
There we go.

64
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:45.497
Some other students have
done this, student['grades'],

65
00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:49.757
and that is a totally
reasonable thing to do,

66
00:02:49.757 --> 00:02:53.836
except the student variable
is a global variable

67
00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:58.695
that is available for every
method, every function.

68
00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:00.824
So whenever we call this function here,

69
00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:04.001
this average grade
function, we're always going

70
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.518
to use this variable here

71
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.670
instead of the argument, which is data.

72
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.667
This means that if we call average grade

73
00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:14.812
with this variable here as an argument,

74
00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:17.125
then it will work fine.

75
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.273
But if we call it with
a different argument,

76
00:03:19.273 --> 00:03:22.393
then it will still use the
student dictionary here,

77
00:03:22.393 --> 00:03:24.757
and it will return incorrect data.

78
00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:28.126
So make sure to use, as, oh sorry.

79
00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:31.148
I'm pressed them to pressing
save on every few seconds,

80
00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:35.261
make sure to use that data argument there.

81
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.425
And finally, implement the function below,

82
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.561
which is average grade for all students.

83
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.515
Given a list of students,

84
00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.775
which as we know are dictionaries,

85
00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:47.214
calculate the average grade of the class.

86
00:03:47.214 --> 00:03:48.820
So, given a list of students,

87
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.268
that's this student list here,

88
00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:52.174
this is the list of our students,

89
00:03:52.174 --> 00:03:55.951
we must add all the grades
of all students together,

90
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.201
and you must also count
how many grades there are

91
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:00.534
in total in the entire list.

92
00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.604
Okay, so we have two
variables, total and count.

93
00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:08.870
Presumably, total must be
the sum of all the grades,

94
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.601
and count must be the amount
of grades that we have.

95
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:14.788
And from each student
in this student list,

96
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.333
we have to add to these two variables

97
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.803
so that at the end, it returns

98
00:04:19.803 --> 00:04:21.247
the total divided by the count,

99
00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:24.411
which should give us the average.

100
00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:26.687
So, how do we calculate the total?

101
00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:30.687
Well, we can say total
equals total plus the sum

102
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.783
of the student grades.

103
00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.705
And then the sum is going
to add up all the values

104
00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:40.473
in a list or a topple,

105
00:04:40.473 --> 00:04:43.268
and the student is, each of the students

106
00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:45.628
in the student list, student grades

107
00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:47.039
will give us that topple.

108
00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.787
Sum will give us the total of that topple,

109
00:04:49.787 --> 00:04:51.751
and it's going to modify
the total variable

110
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:52.584
so that it is the existing number

111
00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:56.251
of total plus the sum
of this other student,

112
00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.241
and the count is going
to be count equals count

113
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:04.408
plus the length of the student grades.

114
00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:07.105
And that is going to give us

115
00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:10.527
the count of student
grades for this student.

116
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:12.761
It's gonna add it to the existing count,

117
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.579
and it's gonna override the count variable

118
00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.722
with that value.

119
00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:18.110
And then at the end,
we're gonna return total

120
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.141
divided by count, which is
going to give us the average.

121
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:25.468
Because it's quite common
to do total = total +

122
00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:28.996
and count = count +, with any variable,

123
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.721
Python gives us a shortcut,

124
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:33.721
which is +=, +=.

125
00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:36.160
So this means the same thing.

126
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.032
Total is gonna add to the total

127
00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:40.505
the sum of the student grades,

128
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:42.808
and it's gonna add to the count

129
00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:46.056
the length of the student grades.

130
00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:49.016
Notice that if you do just count plus

131
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.754
the length of student
grades, you're calculating

132
00:05:51.754 --> 00:05:54.429
what you want, but you
are not assigning it

133
00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:57.137
back to the variable, so
hence, this would not work.

134
00:05:57.137 --> 00:06:00.106
You need the equal sign there.

135
00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:02.281
Let's check the solution,
and it should give us

136
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:04.059
that all is correct.

137
00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:05.523
And indeed, there we go.

138
00:06:05.523 --> 00:06:07.069
So now we've learned a bit more

139
00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.600
about how this sort of works.

140
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.658
Hopefully you managed to do
this on your own earlier,

141
00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:14.191
but if not, hopefully
this clears things up.

142
00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:16.183
I'll see you on the next video.
