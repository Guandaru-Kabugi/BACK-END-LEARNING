00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:01.452
- [Instructor] Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.452 --> 00:00:02.947
We are now at the @classmethod

3
00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:05.335
and @staticmethod coding exercise.

4
00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:08.900
This one is a bit more
of a complicated one.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.043
We have to complete two
method implementations.

6
00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:16.277
The franchise method, which
takes in a store as an argument,

7
00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:18.623
and it should return a new store object

8
00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:22.790
with a name equal to the argument
plus the franchise string.

9
00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:24.808
And the store_details method

10
00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.793
which also takes in a store as an argument

11
00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:27.736
and it should return a string

12
00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.296
representing the argument.

13
00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.754
Okay, let's have a wee look
at exactly what this means.

14
00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:34.310
I've given you a few examples here

15
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.477
of what exactly should be printed out.

16
00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.385
Imagine we have two stores.

17
00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.262
Store is a store with name Test

18
00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:47.415
and store2 is a store with name Amazon

19
00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.283
and in store2 we're gonna add an item,

20
00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.700
Keyboard with a price of 160.

21
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.978
The franchise method is
gonna be called as the store,

22
00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:58.741
the class store.franchise

23
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.739
and we're gonna pass in the store object

24
00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.986
and it's going to return a store object

25
00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:06.486
with name Test - Franchise.

26
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.670
And similarly we call it with
store2 which is called Amazon.

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.404
We're gonna return a store object

28
00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.986
with name Amazon - Franchise.

29
00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:17.282
So notice it's not going to return

30
00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:19.596
the string Amazon - Franchise.

31
00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.377
It's going to return a store object

32
00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:24.044
with name Amazon - Franchise.

33
00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.960
And the store_details is
gonna be called with a store

34
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.043
so store test

35
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.439
and is going to return
Test, the name of the store,

36
00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.189
comma, total stock price is zero.

37
00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:40.200
And similarly if we call it
with store2 which has an item

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.117
it's gonna be Amazon,
total stock price is 160.

39
00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:46.855
Okay?

40
00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:48.388
When completing the store_details method

41
00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:49.993
you may need to convert the output

42
00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:52.950
of store.stock_price to an integer

43
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.271
and you can do this like so,

44
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.299
int(Store.stock_price).

45
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.750
Let's have a look at this coding exercise.

46
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.220
First thing to do is to remind ourselves

47
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.637
of exactly what these existing methods do

48
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.550
and what the store objects are like.

49
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.621
So we've got an init method

50
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.826
that tells us the store
object has two properties:

51
00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:17.909
self.name and self.items.

52
00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:22.796
We can add an item which simply
appends to this empty list

53
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.546
a dictionary with name and price.

54
00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:31.068
And then we have stock_price
which returns the total value

55
00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:34.318
of all the items in stock in this store

56
00:02:35.497 --> 00:02:37.467
as you can see.

57
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:38.942
And then we have our two methods

58
00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.668
that we have to implement ourselves:

59
00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:44.193
the franchise method and
the store_details method.

60
00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:47.741
The franchise method has
to return another store

61
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.058
with the same name as the argument

62
00:02:50.058 --> 00:02:52.891
plus the string " - Franchise."

63
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:55.370
So let's do that.

64
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.037
How do we create a store object?

65
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:03.224
Well we can say something
like new_store = Store

66
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.121
and here we have to give it a name

67
00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:09.062
because if you remember, the
init method takes in a name

68
00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:11.033
so we have to give the store this name

69
00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.821
and we know from the instructions

70
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.692
that the store's name that we return

71
00:03:14.692 --> 00:03:18.451
has to be the same name as the argument

72
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:19.534
so store.name

73
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:26.291
plus this "- Franchise" thing here

74
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.072
so " - Franchise."

75
00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:30.721
Notice that there is a
space before the dash

76
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:32.176
and there's a space after the dash

77
00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:34.481
so we have to make sure to
have those there as well.

78
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.346
This is very important

79
00:03:35.346 --> 00:03:38.922
or else the code checker
won't be able to deduce

80
00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:41.856
that you have the right name.

81
00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:43.389
Okay now that we have created the store

82
00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.302
we can return it.

83
00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:46.703
Return new_store.

84
00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:49.345
That's our variable there.

85
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:53.974
Of course we could just
skip the variable entirely,

86
00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:55.082
return the store.

87
00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:58.020
This is totally fine, same thing.

88
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.736
Because this is a class method

89
00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:02.366
we have this cls argument here

90
00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:05.578
and cls is a reference to the class.

91
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.996
That's Store by the way.

92
00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:10.860
So cls is the same thing as Store

93
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.332
so for the sake of learning

94
00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:13.569
we can just replace them

95
00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.736
and that means exactly the same thing.

96
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.243
Let's move on to the store_details.

97
00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:24.555
This only has to return a string
representing the argument.

98
00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.941
Store is a store object

99
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:28.874
and it has to be something in the format

100
00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:32.338
"NAME, total stock price: TOTAL."

101
00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.714
So I'm gonna copy that

102
00:04:34.714 --> 00:04:37.314
and what I'm gonna do is return this

103
00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:41.481
.format(store.name,
int(store.stock_price())).

104
00:04:47.527 --> 00:04:51.509
Now we have to replace
name for the curly braces

105
00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.646
and total for the curly braces as well.

106
00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:55.479
Here's what's happening here

107
00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.469
I went a bit quickly there.

108
00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.103
We've got our format string

109
00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:02.144
which has two sets of curly braces

110
00:05:02.144 --> 00:05:06.336
and we're gonna go and put
store.name in the first one

111
00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:08.697
and store.stock_price,

112
00:05:08.697 --> 00:05:12.030
this is the method that is defined here,

113
00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:14.551
convert it to an integer,

114
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:18.330
and put it in the second place there.

115
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.741
There are many other ways
that you could do this.

116
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:23.803
You could add the values
together and so on and so forth

117
00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:26.904
but, nevertheless, this is the way I do it

118
00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:29.737
so that's why I'm showing it to you here.

119
00:05:29.737 --> 00:05:32.471
Let's check our solution

120
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.187
and as you can see that is all correct.

121
00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:38.593
We've looked at the cls keyword

122
00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:40.354
and we've implemented the franchise method

123
00:05:40.354 --> 00:05:44.139
to return a new store with a given name

124
00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.650
and we've also looked at
the store_details method

125
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.420
which returns a string representation

126
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.003
of some store data.

127
00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:52.423
So that's everything for this video

128
00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:54.190
and I'll see you on the next one.
