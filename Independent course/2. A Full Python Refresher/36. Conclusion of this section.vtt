00:00:01.332 --> 00:00:04.034
- Congratulations on
finishing this section.

2
00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:07.258
This section was all about
Python, Python programming,

3
00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:11.628
and uncovering every last
little bit of Python syntax.

4
00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:13.828
Now, you've completed this section,

5
00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.715
which means that you are familiar

6
00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.425
with everything Python-related.

7
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.284
Now, that doesn't mean you're an expert,

8
00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:23.618
but it does mean that when we
get to programming REST APIs,

9
00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:25.738
which use all of these concepts,

10
00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.853
you're gonna have a really easy time.

11
00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:30.209
So without further ado,

12
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:32.332
congratulations on
completing this section,

13
00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.013
and I'll see you on the next one.
