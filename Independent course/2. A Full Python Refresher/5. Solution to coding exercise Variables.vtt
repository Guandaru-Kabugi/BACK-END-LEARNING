00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:01.818
- [Instructor] Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:05.152
This was the first coding
exercise in the course

3
00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:08.911
and I've made it
reasonably simple, I hope.

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.954
The instructions are twofold.

5
00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.684
First, create two variables,

6
00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:16.517
which must be called var1 and var2

7
00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.685
and they both have to have the same value,

8
00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:22.251
and the second part of the exercise

9
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.847
is to create two variables
called num1 and num2,

10
00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:28.496
that multiply together to give 16.

11
00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:31.089
So these two must be numbers.

12
00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.648
Okay, so how do we create variables?

13
00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:35.985
Well, we've looked at this just now

14
00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.922
and we know to create a variable,
we have to type the name,

15
00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.477
equals and the value.

16
00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:45.571
So to create these two
variables, var1 and var2,

17
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.621
we're just going to do var1, equals

18
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.852
and then we can put
anything we want such as

19
00:00:53.852 --> 00:00:56.788
"hi "

20
00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.955
and var2 which must have the same value.

21
00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:05.025
So it also equals hi.

22
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:09.791
So that would be the first
part of the exercise done.

23
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:11.658
Now, the second part,

24
00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:14.148
we have to create two
variables, num1 and num2

25
00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:16.789
that multiply together to give 16.

26
00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.801
So, num1 is gonna be four

27
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.801
and num2 is gonna be....

28
00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:24.088
What?

29
00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:29.318
Four too. So four by four is 16

30
00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.946
and then we can press the
green button, Check Solution.

31
00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.466
And that should give us that all is good.

32
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.046
And I did, it says Well done,
your solution is correct.

33
00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:40.287
So hopefully this makes sense

34
00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.829
and this is the first coding exercise.

35
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.972
Instead of num1 being
four and num2 being four,

36
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.812
you could do eight and two for example,

37
00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:49.769
and var1 and var2 can have the same value.

38
00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:50.927
It doesn't matter what it is,

39
00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:55.528
it can be anything as long as
it's naturally a valid python.

40
00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:57.376
So that's everything for this video,

41
00:01:57.376 --> 00:01:59.793
I'll see you on the next one.
